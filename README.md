## Project Overview
This project analyzes Netflix's content catalog using SQL queries to uncover insights about:
- Content distribution (movies vs TV shows)
- Genre popularity trends
- Production patterns by country
- Release timelines and addition patterns
- Director and actor collaborations

## Tools Used
- **DB Browser for SQLite** (primary SQL interface)
- Created SQLite database (`Netflix.db`)
- Basic SQL functions with some intermediate features

## Files Included
1. `netFlix.sql` - Contains all SQL queries
2. `netflix_titles.csv` - Original dataset

## Key Analysis Areas
### 1. Content Overview
- Movies vs TV shows ratio
- Rating distribution
- Content addition trends

### 2. Temporal Analysis
- Monthly addition patterns
- Content age when added
- Release year trends

### 3. Production Insights
- Top production countries
- Director productivity
- Actor-director collaborations

### 4. Content Characteristics
- Movie duration analysis
- TV show seasons breakdown
- Genre combinations

## How to Use This Project

### Setup Instructions
1. Download DB Browser for SQLite
2. Import `netflix_titles.csv` into a new database
3. Open and execute queries from `netFlix.sql`

## Sample Findings
1. **75%** of Netflix content are movies
2. **TV-MA** is the most common rating
3. **United States** produces the most content
4. Most movies are **90-120 minutes** long
5. **November** sees peak content additions

## Potential Extensions
1. Add visualization using Python/R
2. Build a dashboard with Tableau/Power BI
3. Incorporate sentiment analysis on descriptions
4. Compare with competitor datasets
